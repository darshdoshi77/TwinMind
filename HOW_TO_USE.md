## Tips

1. **Wait for Processing**: Don't ask questions about content that's still "Processing"
2. **Be Specific**: More specific questions get better answers
3. **Use Keywords**: Mention topics, subjects, or keywords from your content
4. **Check Sources**: Use the "Sources" button to see what's been indexed

## Troubleshooting

### Content Not Showing Up in Answers?
- Check the "Sources" button - make sure status is "Ready"
- Wait a few more minutes for processing to complete
- Try asking more general questions first

### Upload Failed?
- Check file size (max 500MB)
- Ensure file format is supported
- Check browser console for error messages
- Verify backend is running

### Processing Taking Too Long?
- Large video files (5+ minutes) can take 5-10 minutes
- Audio files typically process in 1-3 minutes
- Documents and text are usually instant
- Check backend logs if stuck in "Processing" for >15 minutes
